* Bill Gates or Gary Kidall? Thomas Edison or Nicola Tesla? Rosalind Franklin or Watson and Crick? Steve(Jobs or Wozniak)?

1. Bill Gates since his impact, although comparabe to Kidall's in the short term, has expanded for about three decades.
2. Edison since his impact in society has been way larger than Tesla's (although that may change)
3. Watson and Crick. Even though both contributed to the discovery of double helix shape of DNA, Francis and Crick's was a larger step and was less likely done by somebody else.

* How might modern data science be disruptive to your industry? 

Agriculture is one of the economic sectors were data has been more scarce and were the use of technology has been lower. The explosion of data coming from sensors and the application of technology to the colllection, storage and analysis of this data, could generate knowledge and insights that are groundbreaking to agriculture in terms of the increasing of yields, profit and economic, social and environmental sustainability.
