    "* data.csv\n",

    "head data.csv # (or .pkl or .json )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see that there is some method to the madness but that each file has its peculiarities. Each file contains a portion of the total dataset that consists of 100 records, so you will need to **read in all of the files and combine them into some standard format** with which you are comfortable. Aim for something standard where each \"row\" is the same format.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you've standardized all of the data, report the following bits of information by **writing them to a .csv file** labeled `question_1.csv`, `question_2.csv` etc. There needs to be separate .csv files for each question below. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using a script to examine and grade your .csv files so please make sure: \n",
    "- The answers are all in one **column** with one answer entry per cell, sorted as stated in the question below. (That is: looking at the .csv in a spreadsheet editor like Google Sheets all answers would be in the 'A' column, with the first entry in A1, the second in A2 etc). \n",
    "- It is strongly recommended that you open each .csv file to ensure the answers are there and displayed correctly! \n",
    "- Don't include quotes around the list items (that is please strip the leading and trailing quotes from an item when you write to the .csv files) (for example, the file should say ```Spain``` instead of ```\"Spain\"```)\n",
