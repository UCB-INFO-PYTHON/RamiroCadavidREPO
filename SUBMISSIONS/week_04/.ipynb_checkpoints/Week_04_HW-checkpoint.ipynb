However, while the brute force algorithm tries one possible solution in each iteration until it finds one that meets the condition defined, the bisection search algorithm tries a set of half the possible solutions in each iteration. This allows this algorithm to discard approximately half the options in each iteration instead of only one and, thus, the larger the set of possible solutions (i.e. the higher the value of $x$), the faster the Bisection search algorithm will converge to the square root of $x$, compared to the Brute force algorithm."
